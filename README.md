# Mental Health Survey Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes mental health data from surveys which comes primarily from people working in the tech industry and is for the years 2014, 2016-2019.
The aim of the project is to find risk factors and groups assosiated with mental health primarily for tech workers. 

## Summary
* In general there doesn't seem to be a strong difference between tech and non-tech workers' mental health. If anything tech workers seem to exhibit just slightly better mental health with the exception being female workers in tech who are struggling more with these issues.

* We need more data to understand how race and remote work influences mental health, but not working remotely seems to be in favor of mental health slightly over full-on remote work.

* The workers in USA exhibit much more mental health concerns than the rest of the world.
